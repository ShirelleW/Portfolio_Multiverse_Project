                I'm from New Jersey, born and raised. I spent most of my time growing up in Orange and attended Newark Public Schools such as Newton St. and Science Park, where I took STEM classes including AP Computer Science. After highschool, I attended vocational school and became a certified welder. I joined a Millwright Construction Union to put my skills to work and had the opportunity to travel across the U.S. East Coast and Midwest. I joined Per Scholas after rekindling my passion for tech and programming and graduated as a fullstack developer. I now work for American Express through Multiverse as a Junior Engineer and hope to advance my career as a developer.
